# Brainstation_DS_admission_challenge

In this repo I've added my approach to the MySQL solution for the admission challenge to the Brainstation data science bootcamp.

The basis of the assignment was that a board game company wanted to raise funding for their project. They need a minimum of 15k to get it rolling and we used historical data of pask kickstarter campaigns to see what we can realistically expect. 

I have only included the preliminary exploratory analysis which needed the analysis of 6 questions that can be found directly in the sql script.
